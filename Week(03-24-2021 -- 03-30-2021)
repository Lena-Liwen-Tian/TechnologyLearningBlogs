I mainly focused on creating the pop up windows. I found a lot of examples online on Ant Design and Bootstrap. It was not so difficult to create 
the window but it took me a long time to fit all the contents in the window. I planned to have a comment block for users to make comments, vote
button for users to "like" the post. Though I found some icons on the web that can be used as the vote button but their colors were not what I like.
I cannot use the icon tag without any modifications. So I decided to change the color by myself. These built-in buttons have their own design style and I 
did not know how to change it at the very beginning. I asked some of my friends who are expertise in front end design about how to change the 
design of the icon from Ant Design, they told me I could look at the class name of that component. They taught me to right click the web page and inspected the
class name of that element. It worked like a magic! I did not know that we could get all the component design in detail only by inspecting the web page. I tried
it by myself and got the class name successfully. I changed the color by using the built-in class name of that icon successfully. I even found that we 
could have a temporary overiview of the component by changing the parameters in the inspection window. This method is very useful for the front end development.
I used this same method when I tried to change the design of the tag icons in the window to categorize different posts and it worked pretty well. Now all windows
are set up, the next step is to connect them with the backend. I plan to run them locally so I need to use local ports. I want to use the popular useEffect
method to fetch the backend. I am not very familar with this method. So I found some relevant tutorials and prepare for my tasks next week.
