This week, I started working on my third project. I am going to create a personal portfolio website to show my work. I think the portfolio website will be helpful
when looking for the job. I compared some websites that can help build the portfolio like WordPress, Squarespace and Wix. I read their descriptions and decided to 
use Wix in the end since it provides customized components which I can drag and expaned based on the contents. I found there were a lot of portfolio templates 
on Wix, I picked up the one I like. I completed the resume and the home page this week. For the resume, I looked through some resume examples of other software 
engineers. I adjusted some of my contents to display my working experiences and education in a time order. For the home page, I wrote some personal descriptions
but I still feel it is a little bit empty. I might insert some photo next week.
