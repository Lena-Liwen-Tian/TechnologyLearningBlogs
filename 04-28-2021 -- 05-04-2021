This week, I edited the images of my project. I tried to insert some images relevant to my project. I thought that I could take a screenshot of project contents
to show it on the project page. However, I found that it did not match the style of my website which was simple and clean. Then I decided to draw some images
reflecting the contents of my project by myself. I searched online and found that I could use the comic book style which only has two colors (black and white). 
I used ipad to draw images. I found there was a useful app called visualization for users to draw images using ipad pencils. I watched some tutoirals about it on
Youtube and learned how to use different tools in this app. I used marker to draw the image and used water pencil to color the background. I picked up some scenes
when users are using the application I built as the content of the image. It took me a long time to finish all of them. I like the final version of these images
though they looks not very professional. Professor Jennifer also helped me edit the contents of my project description. I am going to modify my project based
on her suggestions next week.
