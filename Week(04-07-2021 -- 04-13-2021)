Today, I completed the final modification of the front end development together with the database connection of this application. I 
lost the connection to the AWS today at the very beginning even though I did not change any codes. I tried to restart both my backend
and mySQL GUI but I still could not connect to the RDS on AWS. Then I realized that I forgot to change the IP address in the inbound rule
of AWS database. The IP address on campus is different from the IP address at home. I changed the inbound rule to allow all traffic and then
the connection was created successfully. I also added one "Follow" button in the modal today for users to follow the auther they like. 
The button can only be used one time which means the user is not allowed to follow the same author twice. I searched on React Bootstrap and I 
found there was a parameter called "disable" for the button component. But I still did not know how to set this parameter to be true just after
one-click. I googled this again and found some examples on the StackOverflow. So I just need to add one variable called "haveclick" to track the button status. 
When the button is clicked, the value of "haveclick" becomes true and the "disable" will become true. It looks like a magic. Now it works exactly
in the way I want. This React + SpringBoot + JWT authentcation project is completed. I changed it name to Club Post since I hope it works as 
a club for users to make various posts. I uploaded the screen record when I was using this appliction to my GoogleDrive.
