This week, I uploaded three of my projects into my Portfolio. I never organized the projects I did before. So it takes me a long time to find everything 
and reorganize all meterials I need. I look through some portfolios Professor shared with me. I find that most of students who focused on UX design have a good 
portfolio website. They write how they created the project in detail. They have different sessions like methods, results and etc. It is a little hard for me to follow
their structures since most of my projects are about website development which are too different from others. If I talk about my working process, my portfolio 
will contain too many technial words, which is not friendly to readers. So I decide to record the working demo of all my programming projects. I think this can 
help users understand more easily about what my project is and how different features work. I also upload one data science project. For this one, I write my 
whole working process since I want to let readers understand the functions of different models and how they can be used to solve the problem. I think I still 
need some readers to let me know how I should modify the portfolio. Readers are the target of my portfolio, so I will accumulate some opinions later.
