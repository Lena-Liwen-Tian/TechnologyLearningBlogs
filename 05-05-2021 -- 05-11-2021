This week, I finished my portfolio project. I looked at the comments professor Jennifer gave me in the Google doc. She corrected my grammar mistakes and
also gave me some suggestions about which contents to be shown on the first project page. I thought her advice was pretty good. I made some modifications
for my portfolio. I removed the detailed description from my first portfolio page and used some general information instead. I mainly talked about the tech stacks
I used and the features of different projects. I thought this could let readers grasp the most important thing on the first page. I added the detailed description
into the subpage of each project. Besides this, I created the "interest" page sharing my photos and drawings. I love taking pictures and drawing in my spare time.
I picked up some photos I liked. I hoped this could let readers to know more about my personality not only about my work.

Please feel free to take a look.
