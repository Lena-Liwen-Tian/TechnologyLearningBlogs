For my first learning project, I am going to create the backend service of a web application. Since this is my 
first java project the features of it are very simple. This web application has basic user registration/sign in 
feature and connects to a mySQL database. It can also patch/delete/post/get data from database. This application 
works as a social website for users to read the posts post by people they followed and share their own posts. 
The application can also be used to chat with friends, follow or unfollow friends. Since we only have one month 
for this project, I will only complete the backend service for it.

Today, I downloaded mySQL into my labtop. I created a user table which contains (id, name, password, follow,followed) 
and a post table which contains (id, post, comment, like). Follow is the person the user is following and followed is 
the person following this user. I am thinking to create many-to-many relationship between tables later. I also found 
a good tutorial online teaching Java Spring Boot, the link is https://www.youtube.com/watchv=c4mv4N6i3Jc&list=PL9l1zUfnZkZkmDvzHCoLlc_nHBc7ZXiRO. 
I am going to follow this video to create basic patch/delete/post/get endpoints in my server. Besides, I create a 
mySQL remote database and S3 bucket on AWS to store users' data and images.
