For my first learning project, I am going to create the backend service of a web application. 
Since this is my first java project the features of it are very simple. This web application has basic user registration/sign in feature and connects to a mySQL
database. It can also patch/delete/post/get data from database. This application works as a social
website for users to read the posts post by people they followed and share their own posts. The application
can also be used to chat with friends, follow or unfollow friends. Since we only have one month
for this project, I will only complete the backend service for it.
